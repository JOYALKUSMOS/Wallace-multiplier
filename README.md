# Wallace-multiplier
Wallace Tree Multiplier (WTA) is a parallel multiplier that works on the Wallace Tree algorithm to efficiently multiply two integers.A Wallace multiplier is a hardware implementation of a binary multiplier, a digital circuit that multiplies two integers. It uses a selection of full and half adders (the Wallace tree or Wallace reduction) to sum partial products in stages until two numbers are left.
